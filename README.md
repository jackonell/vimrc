This is my vim configuration. I cleaned it up most of the stuff.

The `vimrc` file should be easy to understand and contains almost everything.

# Install

        git clone https://github.com/jackonell/vimrc.git .vim
        vim +PlugInstall +qall

# other tool to be installed:
## ag:
    centos:  yum install the_silver_searcher
    ubutun:  apt-get install silversearcher-ag
